# React Free Cell

## Setup & Run

- `$ yarn` - setup and download files
- `$ yarn start` - run with local server

## What I have

- start screen
- game screen
- end screen

## Todo

Beside refactoring and cleaning up files, the below is what I would like to work on if I have more time.

- Undo to move a card
- Auto move from cascade columns to foundation when you have proper sequence to move them  
- Add some animation with cards on start / end screen
- Multiple cards move when you have cards in proper sequence and enough room in the free cells
- Add animation when you clear the game
- Responsive if needed
- favicon
- Write test

## Card images are from:
