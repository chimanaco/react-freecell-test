## Todo

Beside refactoring and cleaning up files, the below is what I would like to work on if I have more time.

- Undo to move a card
- Auto move from cascade columns to foundation when you have proper sequence to move them to complete a game 
- Add some animation with cards on start / end screen
- Multiple cards move when you have cards in proper sequence and enough room in the free cells
- Add animation when you complete the game
- Responsive if needed
- favicon if needed
- Write test
